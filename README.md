# MovieLens Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
The MovieLens dataset contains movies and corresponding metadata like release year, genre etc.
Also, it contains rating and tags assigned by users to each movie.
This is my pet Apache Spark SQL project to get my hands dirty in using Spark in a typical data pipeline.
Although all the code in this repository is run on my PC in standalone mode, it serves the purpose of data cleaning
and exploration aspects of a data pipeline without worrying about performance optimizations.
